## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

🚀 Task & Performance Management System (BPOVO)
A robust, role-based Task Management and Employee Performance Tracking system built with Laravel, Filament PHP, and Tailwind CSS. Designed specifically for businesses to streamline task allocation, monitor employee productivity, and enforce granular role and permission hierarchies.

Filament Admin Panel: Clean, high-performance administrative dashboard for managing users, departments, tasks, and system configurations.

Dedicated Employee Portal: Separate login interface (/employee/login) and dashboard for regular employees to manage their assigned tasks in real-time.

Task Management & Workflows: Create tasks, assign them to specific employees, track progress statuses (In-Progress, Completed), and monitor expected completion times.

Employee Reports & Analytics: Detailed daily, weekly, and monthly performance reports with automated Excel and PDF export capabilities.

Workspace Feed (Activity Logs): Real-time system activity tracking and workspace feed logs to monitor team actions.
